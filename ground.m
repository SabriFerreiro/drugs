function out = ground(in)
%BDG     XPDE structure to draw Wigner samples of the ground state
%
%   % GROUND(in) takes an XPDE input structure in of the form returned by
%   STATIC. It returns a similar input structure. This structure is annotated with sound wave modes, and its inital function generates samples of the field according to
%   in.ensembles and in.a.T.

% in.a.T is the condensate temperature, expressed as a square wavenumber in dispersion units.
