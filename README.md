This repository comprises various simulations being developed at Swinburne University of Technology using XPDE.

The `bec` directory is a library for constructing XPDE input structures that represent cold atoms.  Run `help trap` for an introduction.

The `util` directory contains some utility functions for XPDE.  These generate explicit spectral derivative matrices and do the book keeping for various commonly used observables.

The `vienna` directory contains simulations related to the split trap experiment in Vienna.

The `misc` directory contains various Matlab functions that the simulations depend on.
